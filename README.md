# How does it work?
## Parts
### GoPhish 
In order to create the phishing campaign it uses gophish, so the admin of the service can use that same web interface that it provides to create and modify a certain campaign.
### Gatsby
This project exists for this, when active, the point of it is to have a web interface where go-phish information is showed in a more "executive" way, in other words, tons of charts that can be easily understood by a non technical user. It also requires a login screen, so not any random person can access the client's private information.
### Database
### Server
# FAQ
## shell.nix???
If you use NixOS, you can run the front end application within a shell, in order to do that, run the command ´´nix-shell´´ in the same directory as the file, and you will automatically get the packages you need to run the application without installing them system-wide.
# Notes
## front
tech to use:
* Charts: LightningCharts JS
* Front: Gatsby
